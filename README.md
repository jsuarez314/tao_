In hdu 1, you can find a table that contains information to identify the images by sequence, date, MJD, Field ID, observation number in the sequence, or cutout.

| Table of Content HDU:1 (Table) | Description                                                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HDU_Ext                 | Extension number of the image in the fits file.                                   |
| Sequence                | Stands for the sequence (or set number).                                          |
| Date                    | Date of observation in YYMMMDD format.                                            |
| MJD                     | Modified Julian Date.                                                             |
| Field_ID                | Field identifier.                                                                 |
| Obs_In_Seq              | Refers to the observationâ€™s number in the sequence.                               |
| Cutout                  | The cutout matrix location. Each cutout covers an area of ABOUT 5 x 5 arcminutes. |



For non-Transients objects, you can find in the fits images' headers the next information: 


| Header Dict | Description                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| CRTS_ID     | Catalina Real-time Transient Survey  ID from was extrated the non-transient object.     |
| N_Images    | Total number of images for this non-Transient object.     |
| RA_(J2000)  | Right Ascension (degrees).                   |
| Dec_(J2000) | Declination (degrees).                       |
| Img_Ref    | Image of reference where was identified the non-transient object.     |

Also, in hdu 1, you can find a table that contains information to identify the images of non-transients by MJD, date, field id, or cutout.

| Table of Content HDU:1 (Table) | Description                                                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HDU_Ext                 | Extension number of the image in the fits file.                                   |
| MJD                     | Modified Julian Date.                                                             |
| Date                    | Date of observation in YYMMMDD format.                                            |
| Field_ID                | Field identifier.                                                                 |
| Cutout                  | The cutout matrix location. Each cutout covers an area of ABOUT 5 x 5 arcminutes. |
